# Forms Playground
This is my personal playground for playing with forms. 

Forms are pretty crucial to interacting with the internet... whether you're searching for information or checking out at your favorite online shop, you're ~~probably~~ definitely interacting with a form. As a web developer, I always strive to build the best user experience but the reality of working under deadlines means that I don't always have the time to build the most perfect, intuitive, accessible, user-friendly form. Maybe I should fix that by building a playground where I can workshop ideas like building the best hints for errors, etc.
